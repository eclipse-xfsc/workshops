## Introduction

Welcome to the guide on deploying ICAM components in your AWS account. This document will walk you through the necessary steps to set up and configure the components effectively.

### Our Cloud Deployment

![XFSC Deployment](./img/deployment.png)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

### AWS Account

An active AWS account is required for the setup.

### VS Code Editor üíª (Optional)

While optional, using VS Code can facilitate configuration changes.

### Familiarity with AWS/DevOps

Some familiarity with AWS and DevOps will be beneficial for following this documentation.

### Domain Name üìå

Acquire a public domain name from any registrar.

-   If the Domain name you are using is from AWS Route53, you can skip this step.
-   If the Domain name you are using is from a different registrar, please follow the steps below, to make a hosted zone in Route53.
    -   Steps for creating a hosted zone in Route53:
        -   Go to [Route53 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home)
        -   Click on `Hosted Zones` on the left navigation bar.
        -   Click on `Create Hosted Zone`.
        -   Enter the domain name you want to use for your workshop.
        -   Click on `Create`.

You'll need to point this domain to your AWS EC2 instance's public IP address using an A record.

-   **Domain Configurations**: For example, `workshop.learn.smartsenselabs.com`
    -   Create a wildcard entry `*.workshop.learn.smartsenselabs.com` pointing to your EC2 instance's public IP.
    -   Sub-domains that will be created automatically: (don't create these manually)
        -   `keycloak.workshop.learn.smartsenselabs.com`
        -   `vault.workshop.learn.smartsenselabs.com`
        -   `cloud-wallet.workshop.learn.smartsenselabs.com`

### Key Pair for SSH üîê

This setup is prepared for two AWS regions: Spain and Mumbai. Choose one for your deployment.

-   [Create a key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html) in your AWS account in either:
    -   Europe (Spain) `eu-south-2`
    -   Asia Pacific (Mumbai) `ap-south-1`

This key pair will allow SSH access to your EC2 instance.

## Deployment

üöÄ Let's start with the deployment:

### Launch EC2 Instance

1. **Launch an EC2 instance** with the following AMI ID:
    - Spain, Europe (`eu-south-2`): `ami-0cecb7c804cdb1d74`
    - Mumbai, India (`ap-south-1`): `ami-0c278d74f75a46267`
    - **Note**: From this point, you will incur costs on your AWS account for the resources.
    - **Instance Type**: `t3a.2xlarge` (If in Spain region, try `t4g.2xlarge`)
    - **Key Pair**: Use the key pair created in the previous step.
    - **Storage**: 64 GB
    - **Security Group**: Create a new one and add the following inbound rules after launching the instance:
    - Rule 1:
        - Type: `HTTP`
        - Protocol: `TCP`
        - Port Range: `80`
        - Source: `Anywhere` (0.0.0.0/0)
    - Rule 2:
        - Type: `HTTP`
        - Protocol: `TCP`
        - Port Range: `80`
        - Source: `Anywhere` (0.0.0.0/0)
    - Rule 3:
        - Type: `HTTP`
        - Protocol: `TCP`
        - Port Range: `443`
        - Source: `Anywhere` (0.0.0.0/0)
    - Rule 4:
        - Type: `Custom TCP`
        - Protocol: `TCP`
        - Port Range: `30001 - 30020`
        - Source: `Anywhere` (0.0.0.0/0)

### Attach Elastic IP

2. **Attach an Elastic IP** to the instance:
    - In the left navigation bar, under `Network & Security`, click on `Elastic IPs`.
    - Click on `Allocate Elastic IP Address` button.
    - Click on `Allocate`.
    - Once allocated, select that IP, go to actions, and click on `Associate Elastic IP Address`.
    - Select the instance launched in the previous step and click on `Associate`.
    - Keep this Elastic IP handy as it is now the public IP address of the instance and will be used in multiple steps.

### SSH into the Instance

3. **SSH into the instance** üîê:

    - Open your terminal and SSH into the instance:

        ```bash
        ssh -i {path-to-key.pem} ubuntu@{ec2-public-ip}
        ```

    - **SSH Troubleshooting**:

        - **UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!**:

            - If you encounter the error `WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!`:
              ![WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE](./img/unprotected-private-key.png)
            - Execute the following command and then try to SSH again:

                ```sh
                chmod 400 {path-to-key.pem}
                ```

        - **Too many authentication failures**:

            - If you encounter the error `Too many authentication failures`:
              ![Too many authentication failures](./img/too-many-auth.png)
            - Add an additional flag `-o IdentitiesOnly=yes` to your SSH command and try again:

                ```sh
                ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i {path-to-key.pem} ubuntu@{ec2-public-ip}
                ```

    Once you're in the EC2 instance, proceed with changing environment variables and configurations in later steps.

### Update DNS Configurations

4. **Update your DNS configurations**:
    - Point your domain name to the AWS EC2 instance's public IP address with an A record.
    - For example, if your domain name is `workshop.learn.smartsenselabs.com`, add an A record for `*.workshop.learn.smartsenselabs.com` pointing to the Elastic IP associated with the instance. (Set the TTL to 300 seconds)

## Configurations

### Config Changes with VS Code

-   Use VS Code from your local machine to make changes on the EC2 instance.
-   Establish a remote SSH connection to the EC2 instance using VS Code and the SSH file:

    -   Open a new VS Code window, and click on `Connect to`.
    -   Click on `Connect to Host` and select `Add New SSH Host...`.
    -   Enter the entire SSH command into the field. Example:

        ```sh
        ssh -i ./path/to/private-key.pem ubuntu@<ec2-instance-public-ip>
        ```

        Ensure the path to the private key is absolute on your local machine.

    -   Once connected, open the home directory, which is `/home/ubuntu` in this case.

-   Make the following changes:

    -   Go to the Global Search section of VS Code.
    -   Search for `workshop.learn.smartsenselabs.com` and replace it with your desired domain name. Ensure there are no trailing spaces when replacing the domain.

### Build Docker image for Web-ui

```sh
cd /home/ubuntu/projects/pcm-cloud/web-ui

docker build -f deployment/docker/Dockerfile -t web-ui .

cd
```

### Build Docker image for DummyContentSigner Service

```sh
cd /home/ubuntu/projects/ocm-w-stack/credential-issuance/modules/dummycontentsigner

docker build -f deployment/docker/Dockerfile -t dummycontentsigner .

cd
```

### Build Docker image for HTTP NATS Services

```sh
cd /home/ubuntu/projects/pcm-cloud/http-nats-services

docker build -t http-nats-presentation -f presentation.Dockerfile .

cd
```

### IAM User in AWS Accounts

To manage DNS entries for wildcard certificate issuance, create an IAM user with the necessary permissions:

-   Navigate to the `IAM Dashboard` on AWS.
-   Select `Policies` from left sidebar, and then select `Create Policy`.
-   Select `JSON` tab, and paste the following policy document:
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "route53:GetChange",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::change/*"
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": ["route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets", "route53:ListResourceRecordSets"],
                "Resource": ["arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/*"]
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "route53:ListHostedZonesByName",
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
-   Click on `Next`. Give the policy a name, and then click on `Create Policy`.
-   Once the policy is created, select `Users` from left sidebar, and then select `Add user`.
-   Select `Attach existing policies directly` from the dropdown, and then select the policy you just created.
-   Once the user is created, search and open the user and select `Security Credentials`
-   Scroll down a bit to `Access Keys` Section click `Create access key`.
-   Under `Use case` select `Command Line Interface (CLI)`, check the bottom tick mark for confirmation and click `Next`.
-   Mention any short description and then `Create access key`.
-   Once it is done, you will get the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. Copy these values and keep them safe. (You can only see them once)
-   Update these credentials on the Ec2 using VS code or your terminal.

    -   Edit this file: `/home/ubuntu/k8s/k8s-manifest/cert/issuer.yaml`

        -   Change the `hostedZoneID` to the ID of the hosted zone you created in the previous step.(You can get this ID from Route53 Hosted Zone)
        -   Change the `accessKeyID` to the value you copied from AWS.
        -   For the Secret Access Key, enter this command this command to convert the value to base64 format:

            ```sh
            echo -n "your-secret-access-key" | base64
            ```

        -   Copy the output and paste it in this file `/home/ubuntu/k8s/secrets/iam.yaml`
        -   Execute this command to apply the changes:

            ```sh
            kc apply -f /home/ubuntu/k8s/secrets/iam.yaml
            ```

## Deployment Scripts

Now, SSH into the instance using the terminal. In the home directory, you'll find several scripts to assist with the deployment. Execute the scripts in the following order:

### Basic Setup

```sh
bash ./1-basic-setup.sh
```

-   Check weather the clusterissuer is properly configured or not
    ```
    kc get clusterissuer
    kc get cert
    ```
-   If the certificate is not issued, please check the logs of the `cert-issuer` pod. And If it is giving an error, we have to create the certificate manually.

    -   Manually create the certificate:

        -   Execute `sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns -d '\*.workshop.learn.smartsenselabs.com'`
        -   Follow the instructions to create the certificate.
        -   Once create navigate to this directory `cd /etc/letsencrypt/live/workshop.learn.smartsenselabs.com` (Note: you might need to change the user to root by `sudo su root`)
        -   Run `cat cert.pem chain.pem > full-cert.pem`
        -   Then create base64 values of certificate and private key using:

        ```sh
        # Encode the certificate
        base64 -w 0 fullchain.pem > fullchain.pem.base64

        # Encode the private key
        base64 -w 0 privkey.pem > privkey.pem.base64
        ```

        -   Then probably ssh in to the instance in a new terminal or use VS code.
        -   Open this file `/home/ubuntu/k8s/k8s-manifest/cert/wildcard-secret.yaml`
        -   Copy the values `tls.crt: <base64_encoded_certificate>` and `tls.key: <base64_encoded_key>`
        -   Apply the secret file with: `kc apply -f /home/ubuntu/k8s/k8s-manifest/cert/wildcard-secret.yaml`

    -   We will have to perform one more step to provide these certificate to the Keycloak, for that please follow the steps below:

        -   Update the content of these files accordingly:
            -   `xfsc-keycloak.key`: with content of `privkey.pem` file.
            -   `xfsc.crt`: with the content of `fullchain.pem` file.
        -   Execute `sudo openssl x509 -in xfsc.crt -out xfsc-keycloak.pem -outform PEM`

### Databases

```sh
bash ./2-databases.sh
```

-   This script will create the necessary databases.

-   To verify the status of the database pods, execute:

    ```sh
    kc get po -n db
    ```

    -   Please wait until all pods display a status of Ready. This process may take a few minutes.

### Other Basic Services

```sh
bash ./3-services.sh
```

-   This script will set up additional essential services required for the deployment.

### Keycloak

-   Execute the deployment script for Keycloak:

```sh
bash ./4-keycloak.sh
```

-   We will have to wait for a few minutes for keycloak to be ready.

-   After deployment, access Keycloak at keycloak.<your-domain>

### HashiCorp Vault

-   Deploy HashiCorp Vault by running:

```sh
bash ./5-vault.sh
```

-   Make a maunal change using the following commands:

```sh
export EDITOR=nano
kc edit sts vault -n vault
```

Add init container

```yaml
initContainers:
    - args:
          - -c
          - chmod -R 755 /vault/data && chown 1000:1000 /vault/data
      command:
          - /bin/sh
      image: busybox
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      name: set-permissions
      resources: {}
      securityContext:
          privileged: true
          runAsUser: 0
```

Edit security context of main container:

```yaml
securityContext:
    fsGroup: 1000
    runAsGroup: 1000
    runAsUser: 1000
```

Delete the vault pod:

```sh
kc delete po vault-0 -n vault
```

-   Post-deployment, access Vault at vault.<your-domain>

### Common Services

-   Deploy the Common Services:

```sh
bash ./6-common-services.sh
```

-   Wait for the pods to be ready

### OCM-W Stack Components

-   Deploy the OCM-W stack components:

```sh
bash ./7-ocm-w.sh
```

-   This will set up the necessary components for the OCM-W stack in your environment.
-   We will just have to disable health checks in `dummycontentsigner` service.

    ```sh
    kc edit deploy dummycontentsigner
    ```

-   Wait for the pods to be ready

### Kong Gateway

-   Deploy the Kong Gateway:

```sh
bash ./8-kong.sh
```

-   Wait for the pods to be ready

### Build the Docker Image for Account Service

### PCM Cloud Components
